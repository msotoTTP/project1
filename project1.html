            You will be building an app that works similarly to the guided project in unit 1.

            Requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tapping anywhere on the screen should change the color
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tapping three times should take you back to the original color
                </li>
                <li>
                    It can be any three colors, but make sure that they are different enough from each other
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>

                Here is an example of how your app should work if you used the colors white, black, and red:
